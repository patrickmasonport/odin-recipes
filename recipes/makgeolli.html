    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Makgeolli is a traditional Korean rice wine, slightly sweet and milky, with a low alcohol content.</p>
    <p>It is made from a mixture of fermented rice, water, and a fermentation starter called nuruk. Makgeolli is known for its refreshing taste and slight effervescence, making it a popular beverage in Korea.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Short-grain rice</li>
        <li>Nuruk (Korean fermentation starter)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Yeast (optional)</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps to Make Makgeolli</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly until the water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Soak the rice in water for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
                <li>Drain the rice and steam it until fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the Starter Mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the cooled rice and nuruk.</li>
                <li>Add water to the mixture, using approximately equal parts rice and water.</li>
                <li>If using yeast, dissolve it in a small amount of water and add to the mixture.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ferment the Mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the mixture to a clean fermentation jar or container.</li>
                <li>Cover the jar with a clean cloth or lid, allowing some airflow.</li>
                <li>Leave the jar at room temperature for 5-7 days, stirring daily.</li>
                <li>The mixture will become bubbly and frothy as it ferments.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Strain and Bottle the Makgeolli:
            <ul>
                <li>After fermentation, strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to separate the liquid from the solids.</li>
                <li>Bottle the strained liquid, leaving some space at the top for carbonation.</li>
                <li>If desired, add sugar to taste before bottling.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Store and Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Store the bottled makgeolli in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Shake well before serving, as the rice sediment will settle at the bottom.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
